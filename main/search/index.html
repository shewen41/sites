The service responsible for processing branch and account creation events from the Core Banking Application (CBA) and submitting the branch and account details to the ICAD system. The service ensures proper integration with the NIBSS ICAD system and manages the lifecycle of branch and account records, from creation to successful submission. At the system level, the ICAD service interacts with: ICAD consists of the following containers: The ICAD service subscribes to a Kafka topic where branch creation events are published by the CBA system. The system checks if the branch code already exists in the database. If it exists, the message is acknowledged without further processing. The service generates a 9-digit ICAD branch code using the formula: The branch details are stored in the database after validation: Once the branch details are persisted in the database, the Kafka message is acknowledged. The ICAD service composes the branch creation request with the following field mappings: The composed request is sent to the ICAD system for processing, and the response is used to update the corresponding record in the database. The service updates the database based on the ICAD response: The ICAD service updates the `upload_status` field according to the response received from ICAD: The service updates the `upload_status` field based on the response received from ICAD. Below are the ICAD response codes, their descriptions, and how the system updates the `upload_status`: | ICAD Response Code | Description                                    | Upload Status |\n|--------------------|------------------------------------------------|---------------|\n| 00                 | The function call was successful               | UPLOADED      |\n| 02                 | Partial Success                                | ERROR         |\n| 44                 | Invalid Branch Code                            | FAILED        |\n| 45                 | Invalid Branch Name                            | FAILED        |\n| 46                 | Invalid Branch Location                        | FAILED        |\n| 54                 | Invalid Request Id                             | FAILED        |\n| 55                 | Invalid Unique Customer Id                     | FAILED        |\n| 56                 | Invalid Institution Code                       | FAILED        |\n| 59                 | Invalid Account Number                         | FAILED        |\n| 60                 | Invalid Account Name                           | FAILED        |\n| 63                 | Security Violation                             | FAILED        |\n| 64                 | Invalid Account Designation                    | FAILED        |\n| 65                 | Invalid Account Status                         | FAILED        |\n| 66                 | Invalid Account Type                           | FAILED        |\n| 67                 | Invalid BVN                                    | FAILED        |\n| 68                 | Invalid Currency                               | FAILED        |\n| 69                 | Invalid RC Number                              | FAILED        |\n| 86                 | JSON Generation Exception                      | ERROR         |\n| 87                 | JSON Mapping Exception                         | ERROR         |\n| 88                 | IO Exception                                   | ERROR         |\n| 89                 | Exception                                      | ERROR         |\n| 96                 | System Malfunction                             | INCONCLUSIVE  |\n| 99                 | Request Failed                                 | FAILED        |\n| 100                | Invalid Old Account Number                     | FAILED        |\n| 101                | Invalid Phone Number                           | FAILED        |\n| 102                | Invalid TIN                                    | FAILED        |\n| 103                | Invalid PEP                                    | FAILED        |\n| 104                | Invalid Sector Code                            | FAILED        |\n| 105                | Savings or current accounts must be in local currency | FAILED        | These mappings ensure that the service responds correctly to ICAD responses, updating the internal `upload_status` field accordingly.
